Royal Montreal to host Canadian Open for 10th time in 2014

The RBC Canadian Open will return to the Royal Montreal Golf Club in 2014.

The course, which was home to the inaugural edition of the national open championship in 1904, will serve as tournament host for the 10th time.

"Royal Montreal shares a long and storied history with both Golf Canada and Canada's national open championship dating back more than a century," Golf Canada chief executive officer Scott Simmons said Monday in a release.

"We are thrilled to add to that special legacy again in 2014."

The Royal Montreal Golf Club most recently hosted The Presidents Cup in 2007. The club last hosted the national open championship in 2001.

The 2013 event will be played July 25-28 at Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville, Ont. The Royal Montreal event will be played July 24-27, 2014.
